All things cats, kittens, tigers and turbulence related. 

you can install the python environment by downloading a python distribution (go to python.org).

I highly recommend you create a virtual environment as well; so do one of the following
in command line terminal


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

(note the periods; they are necessary)

Make a folder, copy the requirements.txt file into it, then type these commands; this
assumes your python.exe is in your terminal path. 

```
python -m venv .
cd Scripts
./activate
cd ..
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
